In reality, there are always various constraints, such as work taking up most of my time, wanting to relax during breaks, spending time with my kids, or accompanying family on weekends. I always feel that time is not enough, and I am often tired. Time passes quickly, year after year, and I feel like I haven&#39;t accomplished anything. Many things I start end up being abandoned after a while. I feel exhausted forcing myself to do things during my rest time, and I don&#39;t have any time for myself.</p><p>Looking back, the only thing I have consistently stuck with over the years is fitness. Part of the reason is that I am addicted and have a strong will, and part of it is that it has become integrated into my life; it has become a habit. From this experience, I think other things can also be approached in a similar way. Fitness has indeed brought some changes to my life, and I have some insights to share:</p><h2 id="_1-the-value-of-persistence-long-term-mindset" tabindex="-1">1. The Value of Persistence [Long-Term Mindset] <a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-the-value-of-persistence-long-term-mindset" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;1. The Value of Persistence [Long-Term Mindset]&quot;">​</a></h2><p>When doing something, don&#39;t expect immediate results. First, analyze whether it is useful and if it is something you need, then go ahead and do it. Even if there are no immediate results, it is still a form of accumulation. Doing something should not be expected to bring changes in a short time; it is a long-term endeavor, measured in years, and should become a part of life. It&#39;s okay to take breaks or pause, but don&#39;t give up completely because of interruptions. In my life, I have given up on many things, some after a few days, others after a few months or half a year, always giving up when I didn&#39;t see hope. In reality, if something is not valuable, it&#39;s okay to give up. But if it is valuable to me, I should persist for a long time, not just for short-term rewards. Even if there are no obvious rewards, the process itself is meaningful for personal growth.</p><p>For example, when I started exercising, I would go a few times a month and feel like there was no effect. Later, I changed my mindset and stopped focusing on physical changes, instead enjoying the pleasure of exercise. Gradually, exercise became a part of my life.</p><h2 id="_2-the-necessity-of-learning-lifelong-growth" tabindex="-1">2. The Necessity of Learning [Lifelong Growth] <a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-the-necessity-of-learning-lifelong-growth" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;2. The Necessity of Learning [Lifelong Growth]&quot;">​</a></h2><p>People should maintain a lifelong learning attitude. In the past, when I was in school, I was naive and thought that once I started working, I could rest and enjoy life. Many parents also told us this. Now, seeing older people, many of whom cannot keep up with societal developments and struggle with technology, relying on their children for help, I feel a deep sense of crisis. I don&#39;t want to be in a position where I need help from others when I am older. I want to always have the ability to solve problems and understand that there is a solution to every problem; it&#39;s just a matter of time. I need to spend my entire life cultivating and improving myself.</p><p>With the rapid development of new technologies and innovations, it is easy to be left behind if one does not actively learn and stay informed. Therefore, I now consciously pay attention to new knowledge, even if work is busy, I make time to learn. I constantly maintain a sense of crisis and improve my ability to solve various problems in life.</p><h2 id="_3-cognition-and-accumulation-present-choices" tabindex="-1">3. Cognition and Accumulation [Present Choices] <a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-cognition-and-accumulation-present-choices" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;3. Cognition and Accumulation [Present Choices]&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Everything I have now is a result of my past accumulations; what I am doing now will only bear fruit in the future. Complaining about not getting something is useless. People can only get what matches their cognition. Not getting something means not yet possessing the abilities beyond that.</p><p>What we currently lack often stems from insufficient past accumulation. Our achievements reflect our past efforts. Therefore, the new skills we learn today, though they may not be immediately useful, will undoubtedly play a crucial role in the unknown future.</p><h2 id="_4-time-management-bit-by-bit" tabindex="-1">4. Time Management [Bit by Bit] <a class="header-anchor" href="#_4-time-management-bit-by-bit" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;4. Time Management [Bit by Bit]&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Time is squeezed out; not having large blocks of time doesn&#39;t mean there are no fragments of time. Waking up at 5:30 AM allows me to complete my fitness training without consuming work or family time. One day, two days, three days, a week without time doesn&#39;t mean a month without time. Even if I only manage to find a little time this month, maybe next month I can find more. As long as I keep doing it, that&#39;s enough, because long-term accumulation will eventually bear fruit.</p><h2 id="_5-goals-and-persistence-continuous-improvement" tabindex="-1">5. Goals and Persistence [Continuous Improvement] <a class="header-anchor" href="#_5-goals-and-persistence-continuous-improvement" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;5. Goals and Persistence [Continuous Improvement]&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Many things, in reality, aim high, achieve medium, aim medium, achieve low, or even achieve nothing. So, don&#39;t easily lower your standards. The lower your standards, the more likely you are to develop according to your expectations. Do things with high standards for yourself. As an ordinary person without special talents, I will likely achieve average or below-average results. But at least, compared to my past self, I will always be better.</p><h2 id="reality" tabindex="-1">Reality <a class="header-anchor" href="#reality" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Reality&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Life is short, only about 30,000 days. Some people are very lucky, whether in birth or talent, starting from a higher point than others; some people seem unlucky, and even with effort, they cannot reach others&#39; starting point. But everyone is writing their unique life story, and there is no need for excessive comparison. Keep your own pace, try to live with fewer regrets, make today&#39;s self better than yesterday&#39;s, and make the present self surpass the past self. Such a life is already very meaningful.</p><p>Every choice and every persistence in life shapes the future self. Although they may seem insignificant now, these bits and pieces will eventually converge into a river. Instead of envying others&#39; exciting lives, focus on making the most of each day.</p><div class="language- vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang"></span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span></span></span></code></pre></div>',21)]))}const f=t(o,[["render",s]]);export{u as __pageData,f as default};
