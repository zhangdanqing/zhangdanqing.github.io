Recently, I saw a trainer online who mentioned that it took him five years to completely fix his forward humerus issue. Reflecting on my own training, I realized that I&#39;ve only been seriously working on my upper back and shoulder girdle for about two years. It might take more intense and consistent training to overcome 20+ years of bad posture habits.</p><p>So, for my recent fitness plan focusing on back training, I need to adjust my training methods. After a thorough warm-up, I ensure my scapula is in the correct position. The main focus of the training is on the upper back, intensely working the rear deltoid, and strengthening the middle and lower trapezius/rhomboid muscles. Finally, I train the lower back.</p><p>Today, I learned a few new moves that gave me a good pump in the rear deltoid. I&#39;ll share them below.</p><h4 id="i-high-neck-pull-down" tabindex="-1">I. High Neck Pull-Down <a class="header-anchor" href="#i-high-neck-pull-down" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;I. High Neck Pull-Down&quot;">​</a></h4><p>The high neck pull-down can be used as a warm-up exercise to make the shoulder girdle muscles more flexible and increase the range of motion.</p><ol><li>High Neck Pull-Down</li></ol><p>1.1. Key Points:</p><ul><li>Lean your body slightly forward, arch your back a bit, and use a medium-wide grip (since my shoulders are narrow, don&#39;t go too wide). Pull down towards the back of your neck.</li></ul><p>1.2. Purpose:</p><ul><li>If the weight is light, it&#39;s particularly suitable for warming up, making the rear deltoid and surrounding muscle groups more flexible and increasing the range of motion. If the weight is heavier, it can also work the upper back.</li></ul><h4 id="ii-forward-high-pull-down-middle-and-lower-trapezius" tabindex="-1">II.

Forward High Pull-Down (Middle and Lower Trapezius)&quot;">​</a></h4><p>Previously, I used a narrow grip for pull-downs to work the middle and lower trapezius. Now, I use a wide grip with a bar, which feels more effective. Similar to seated rows, a narrow grip works the overall muscle, while a wide grip targets the middle part more effectively. The same applies to pull-downs; a wide grip feels better for targeting the middle part.</p><ol><li>Forward High Pull-Down</li></ol><p>1.1.

Bend over and use a medium-wide grip to pull towards the back of your neck, or pull towards the front of your neck, similar to a face pull.
