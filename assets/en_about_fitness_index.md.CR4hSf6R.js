Upper Limb Training Injuries and Shoulder Joint Popping&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Reflecting on the year 2024, my training frequency was quite high, especially for upper limb exercises, particularly pull-ups done weekly. Over time, during upper limb training, whether it was for the back, shoulders, or chest, I started to experience shoulder joint popping. Both the front and back deltoids would pop during training. Eventually, this discomfort extended into my daily life, where even simple actions like picking up items, turning over in bed, or moving my shoulder would result in popping. This was quite distressing, and I tried many methods to address it. It took nearly half a year of improvements to gradually return to a state without popping.</p><h2 id="ii-improving-shoulder-joint-popping" tabindex="-1">II.
