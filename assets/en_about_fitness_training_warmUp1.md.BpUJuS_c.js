Upper limb corrective training as a warm-up is highly beneficial. It helps to restore the scapula to its normal position before proceeding with regular training. Not only does it improve the quality of the subsequent formal training, but it also leaves my back and scapula feeling much more comfortable and naturally opened up, transitioning from a slouched to an expanded state. Here, I document the upper limb warm-up and corrective training techniques I&#39;ve learned online.</p><h4 id="adjusting-the-scapula-s-position-from-top-to-bottom-correcting-slumped-shoulders-enlarged-trapezius-in-women-and-adjusting-body-structure" tabindex="-1">Adjusting the Scapula&#39;s Position from Top to Bottom, Correcting Slumped Shoulders, Enlarged Trapezius in Women, and Adjusting Body Structure <a class="header-anchor" href="#adjusting-the-scapula-s-position-from-top-to-bottom-correcting-slumped-shoulders-enlarged-trapezius-in-women-and-adjusting-body-structure" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Adjusting the Scapula&#39;s Position from Top to Bottom, Correcting Slumped Shoulders, Enlarged Trapezius in Women, and Adjusting Body Structure&quot;">​</a></h4><p>I. Inverse High Pull-down + Barbell Shoulder Shrugs (Corrective Training) Perform 3 sets of 8-10 reps of Inverse High Pull-down (light weight) followed by 8-10 reps of Shoulder Shrugs (light weight, or using a stick) overhead.</p><ol><li>Inverse High Pull-down 1.1. Notes:</li></ol><ul><li>For the Inverse High Pull-down, sit backwards, slightly tilt your head back, pull to the neck, and let the scapula naturally lift and rotate upwards while keeping your arms slightly bent. 1.2. Purpose:</li><li>To restore the scapula&#39;s ability to lift and rotate upwards, and to extend the spine backwards. Adjust the scapula&#39;s vertical position from bottom to top.</li></ul><ol start="2"><li>Overhead Shoulder Shrugs 2.1. Notes:</li></ol><ul><li>Use a small barbell, with your forearms not perpendicular to the ground but slightly inward, placed on top of your head. Extend your arms towards the ceiling while inhaling. 2.2. Purpose:</li><li>To restore the scapula&#39;s lifting and rotating position, adjusting the scapula&#39;s vertical position from top to bottom.</li></ul><p>II. Alternating Dumbbell Rotational Shoulder Press + High Pull-down (Regular Training) Perform 4 sets of 10-12 reps of Alternating Dumbbell Rotational Shoulder Press (medium weight) followed by 10-12 reps of High Pull-down (medium weight).</p><ol><li>Alternating Dumbbell Rotational Shoulder Press 1.1. Details:</li></ol><ul><li>Rotate while pressing upwards, inhale with palms facing up. 1.2. Purpose:</li><li>The alternating motion enhances thoracic mobility, and the rotation during the press aligns the humerus of the upper arm with the glenoid cavity of the scapula better.</li></ul><ol start="2"><li>High Pull-down 2.1. Notes:</li></ol><ul><li>Pull down normally to the lowest point with forearms perpendicular to the ground. The key is during the return; try to lift the scapula as much as possible while moving your arms upwards (simplified version: push the scapula upwards with arms extended). 2.2. Purpose:</li><li>To improve slumped shoulders, use a moderate grip width, and focus on a significant scapula lift during the eccentric phase.</li></ul><p>III. After completing these corrective exercises, proceed with the regular upper limb training routine.</p>',14)]))}const c=t(a,[["render",l]]);export{m as __pageData,c as default};
